    // This cycle is typically executed once for every complete unit test,
    // or once every dozen or so cycles of the three laws. The rules of this cycle are simple.
    //
    // 1. Create a unit tests that fails
    // 2. Write production code that makes that test pass.
    // 3. Clean up the mess you just made.
